#Everit knowledgebase

##Introduction

The goal of the cookbook is to have a central place where all documentation of Everit is accessible with samples.

## How to read the cookbook?

You have several options. You can check out the Git repository and open
doc/index.html on your computer.

If you do not know how to do it, the best practice is to start reading
index.html via [gh-pages][1].
