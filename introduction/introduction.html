  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>This documentation is the curriculum of Everit Ltd. When a new colleague joins our development team, her or his
    first task to do is to read through this cookbook. After reading and understanding each and every line, it should
    not be a problem to join any of our projects. Since Everit provides many OpenSource tools and components, the
    curriculum of Everit became OpenSource as well. To be able to work with our OSS solutions, it is important to study
    the content of this book first.</p>

  <p>The documentation changes from time to time. When a technology becomes deprecated, the related sections will be
    grased from the documentation. As the book is stored in a Git repository, it is possible to find its older revisions
    as well. Therefore, when someone joins a project, for which older technologies are required, it is possible to find
    the right the revision of the curriculum. E.g.: It might happen that we change the build tool we use from Maven to
    Gradle. In that case, all Maven based chapters will be rewritten, but the earlier chapters about Maven will be
    available from the revision history.</p>

  <p>
    Our architecture is currently based on <a href="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi</a>. Therefore, it is very important to
    have a basic understanding of the way OSGi works.
