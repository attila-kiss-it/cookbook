	<h1>Development tools (installation and usage)</h1>

	<h2>Content of the tutorial</h2>
	<p>The aim of this tutorial is to describe how to get started with
		the development tools we use at Everit. Please follow each step
		carefully! Do not worry if you do not know any of the technologies,
		they will be introduced in later chapters. When reading this section,
		please focus on the IDE, its settings and its usage only.</p>

	<h2>Step 1: Installing Java</h2>
	<p>
		Download <a
			href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle
			Java SDK 7</a>. In case you prefer id, you can download OpenJDK as well.
		Note that as soon as a stable version of Java 8 is available, we will
		migrate all our components to it. The reason is that Java 8 will
		introduce <a
			href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html">Lambda
			expressions</a> that will allow us to replace all our anonymous classes
		in our codes.
	</p>

	<h3>Installing Java on Linux</h3>

	<p>On Linux, the newest OpenJDK package has to be downloaded and
		installed from the repository of the given Linux distribution.</p>

	<h3>Installing Java on Windows</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
				Download the latest Java SDK from <a href="http://www.oracle.com">http://www.oracle.com</a>.
				In case your system is 64bit compatible, it is recommended to
				download the x64 version.
			</p></li>
		<li><p>Install Java by running the exe file you downloaded.
				Normally, you have to press "next", "next" and "finish". The default
				installation path of java is "c:/Program Files/java".</p></li>
		<li><p>
				Add the <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Microsoft_Windows">environment
					variable</a> "JAVA_HOME" with the value of the location of your Java
				instance. Do not put the slash on the end of the pathname!
			</p></li>
		<li><p>Extend the PATH environment variable with
				"%JAVA_HOME%\bin;". You should put this before all the other values
				of PATH. The reason is that a java.exe is created in the directory
				c:\Windows\System32 after installation. In case a JRE is installed
				with a newer version, this java.exe will be replaced. If the
				c:\Windows\System32 folder is before the %JAVA_HOME%\bin value in
				the PATH environment variable, it may happen that the first java.exe
				in the PATH is different from the one located in JAVA_HOME. This
				would cause a lot of inconveniences.</p></li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Step 2: Installing Maven</h2>

	<p>Maven is the build tool Everit projects are compiled with. It
		can be installed with the following steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>
				Download the latest stable build of Maven from <a
					href="http://maven.apache.org">http://maven.apache.org</a>
			</p></li>
		<li><p>Unzip maven into a directory of your choice</p></li>
		<li><p>In windows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Add M2_HOME to the environment variables where the
						value is the path of the folder of your Maven installation,
						without a slash in the end. Do not worry if you use Maven3, the
						name of the environment variable is still M2_HOME.</p></li>
				<li><p>Append the value of PATH environment variable with
						"%M2_HOME%\bin"</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In Linux: Create a symbolic link that points to the mvn script
				file at /usr/local/bin</p></li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Step 3: Installing Eclipse</h2>
	<p>
		Download the latest stable version of <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a>. You will need
		the "Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers" version. It is a platform
		dependent ZIP file that you can uncompress into any folder. You can
		start Eclipse with the binary file located in the root directory of
		Eclipse (eclipse.exe in Windows or eclipse in Linux).
	</p>

	<p>The above version of Eclipse should already contain the Git and
		the M2E plugins, which are necessary to continue this tutorial.</p>

	<h3>Customize the Java editor</h3>
	<p>Based on the practice of the past years, it is best to set up
		the Java editor in the following manner:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Click </p></li>
		<li><p>Show 120 column line</p></li>
		<li><p>Show line numbers</p></li>
		<li><p>ctrl+f - format code</p></li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Configuring Java formatter</h3>
	<p class="todo">TODO Get the formatter from the conventions project</p>

	<h3>Configuring "Clean up and Save Actions"</h3>
	<p class="todo">TODO</p>

	<h3>Configuring the XML/HTML formatter</h3>
	<p class="todo">TODO Line width 120, indent 2 spaces</p>

	<h3>Setting up Checkstyle</h3>
	<p class="todo">TODO Setting it in Eclipse</p>
