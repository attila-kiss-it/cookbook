  <h1>Task howto collection</h1>
  <p>This section describes the common tasks carried out within the steps of the cookbook. Since many of these tasks
    are repeated many times throughout the book, it is better to have a section dedicated to describe these specific
    tasks so that its relevant paragraphs can be linked, whenever it is necessary.</p>
  <h2 id="open_system_file_with_eclipse">Open special files in Eclipse</h2>
  <p>Not all files are shown within the "Project Explorer" view. For example, the following files are not shown:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Eclipse configuration files within the project, like .project, .classpath and the .settings folder</p></li>
    <li><p>Generated files in the target folder</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>To open these files, we have the following options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>
        <a href="#open_views_in_eclipse">Open the Navigator view</a>, and search for the required file in it. The
        navigator shows every file, even the generated ones.
      </p></li>
    <li><p>Press ctrl+shift+R. With this shortcut, you can search for every file in the workspace. You are also
        allowed to use wildcards for your search.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="open_views_in_eclipse">Open a view in Eclipse</h2>
  <p>Views are sub-windows in Eclipse. Views can be resized, or placed into any area of the workspace. To open a
    view that is not yet on the screen, select the "Window -&gt; Show View" menu item. There are some views by default
    in the list, but if you cannot find the view you are looking for there, you can search for other views by selecting
    the "Other..." menu item.</p>

  <h2 id="git_ignore_for_eclipse_java_project">Setting .gitignore for Eclipse based java project</h2>
  <p>
    One of the great things you get with maven is that you do not have to commit the settings of your IDE with the
    sources into your version control system. It is also a common mistake if a developer commits the compiled binaries,
    thereby making the size of the repository irreversibly large. In case of Eclipse based Java projects, many issues
    can be solved by <a href="#open_system_file_with_eclipse">creating/appending</a> a .gitignore file into the root of
    every maven project (also to the root of sub-modules) with at least the following content:
  </p>
  <div class="source-code source-xml">
    <pre>
/.settings
/target
/.classpath
/.project
/.checkstyle
</pre>
  </div>
  <p>Based on the plugins you use in your IDE, other files should also be included in .gitignore.</p>

  <h2 id="checking_out_from_github_in_eclipse">Checking out a repository from Github in Eclipse</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Start Eclipse.</p></li>
    <li><p>Switch to the "Git Repository Exploring" perspective in Eclipse. (Window -&gt; Open perspective
        -&gt; Other..., Select the perspective from the list)</p></li>
    <li><p>On the left side, you see the "Git Repositories" window. Click on the "Clone button".</p> <img
      class="screenshot" src="clone_git_repository.gif" /></li>
    <li><p>In the "Clone Git Repository" window, enter the URL of the Git repository as you see below.</p> <img
      class="screenshot" src="source_git_repository.gif" /></li>
    <li><p>
        Click Next, Next and Finish. The repository should be checked out to the "<span style="font-style: italic;">USER_HOME</span>/git/<span
          style="font-style: italic;">REPO_NAME</span>" directory.
      </p></li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="ds_and_metatype_in_pom">Adding Declarative Services and Metatype code generation to the pom.xml</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="http://wiki.osgi.org/wiki/Declarative_Services">Declarative Services</a> allows the programmers to define
    components that are instantiated based on configuration. <a href="http://blog.osgi.org/2011/03/metatypes.html">Metatype</a>
    allows us to define the configuration possibilities of a Component in a way that it can appear on the OSGi Web
    Console as well. Component structures and their configuration possibilities can be defined via XML files. However,
    it is also possible to put these definitions as annotations into the Java source. There are several annotation sets
    and code generators for Declarative Services and Metatype. Since the Felix implementation has the best support for
    maven-eclipse, it is presented in the following example. To use the Felix implementation, put the following snippet
    into the pom.xml file of the project:
  </p>
  <div class="source-code source-xml">
    <pre>
  &lt;build&gt;
    ...
    &lt;plugins&gt;
      ...
      &lt;plugin&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.felix&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-scr-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.20.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;executions&gt;
          &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;generate-scr-scrdescriptor&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
              &lt;goal&gt;scr&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
          &lt;/execution&gt;
        &lt;/executions&gt;
      &lt;/plugin&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
    ...  
  &lt;/build&gt;
 
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    ...
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.felix&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;org.apache.felix.scr.annotations&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.9.8&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;</pre>
  </div>
  <p>This code generator (as all the others) checks the classes for annotations, extends the MANIFEST headers and
    generates the standard Declarative Services and Metatype XMLs in the target/classes folder of the project. This
    means that during runtime, the DS and Metatype technologies do not use the annotations, but only the XML and
    MANIFEST header entries.</p>
  <p>As soon as m2e-lifecycle is available for the standard org.osgi.* annotations, this part of the tutorial will
    be replaced with the description of that annotation set.</p>

  <h2 id="creating_a_property">Creating a class property in Eclipse</h2>
  <p>Java properties are member variables with getter and setter methods. In the most cases, these member variables
    are private. There are several ways to create properties. Here is an example of creating a property "private long
    fooId":</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Create the member variable in the class by typing it:</p>
      <div class="source-code source-xml">
        <pre>
public class Foo {

  <b>private long fooId;</b>
}</pre>
      </div></li>
    <li><p>Generate getters and setters. You have several options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
            <b>Option 1:</b> start typing "set" in the source of the class and press CTRL+SPACE. The content assist will
            appear and let you select the setter method. If you select that, the setter will be generated right there.
            You can generate the getter in the same way.
          </p></li>
        <li><p>
            <b>Option 2:</b> Press ALT+SHIFT+S in the source of the class and select "Generate getters and setters" from
            the context menu. In the dialog, you can select, which getters and setters you would like to generate.
          </p></li>
      </ul></li>
    <li><p>The final code should look like this:</p>
      <div class="source-code source-xml">
        <pre>
public class Foo {

	private long fooId;
	
	public long getFooId() {
		return fooId;
	}
	
	public void setFooId(long fooId) {
		this.fooId = fooId;
	}
}</pre>
      </div></li>
  </ol>
